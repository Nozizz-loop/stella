stella is a Python package to create and train a neural network to identify stellar flares.
Within stella, users can simulate flares as a training set, run a neural network, and feed
in their own data to the neural network model. stella returns a probability at each data point
that that data point is part of a flare or not. stella can also characterize the flares identified.
